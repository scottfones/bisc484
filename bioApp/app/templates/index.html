        This web app was designed to supplement BISC 484 by reproducing some of the data and figures generated during the semester. I hope you find it useful, especially when putting your papers together.

        Using the navigation bar, select protein or gene. If you haven't uploaded a dataset, select the input option from the dropdown. The input pages allow you to enter NCBI Accession Numbers, or upload a FASTA formatted file. Your input will be stored and can be accessed directly by selecting results from the dropdown.
        <br><br>
        Loading the results page for a new dataset may take a significant amount of time. However, subsequent views should be at least an order of magnitude faster.
