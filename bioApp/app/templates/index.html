    <p>
    This web app was designed to supplement BISC 484 by reproducing some of the data and figures generated during the semester.

    The menu bar allows you to generate protein or genetic data by inputting a list of NCBI Accession values. These values are stored, and their corresponding datasets can be found via the results sub-menu options.
